# World_Weather_Analysis
In this project I utilized api's and what they can do such as using them to generte and populate tabels with data.With this project 
we used to differnt apis one from google maps and another one from openwathermap.the goal was to use both to create a vacation search
program that would generate a buch of longitudes and latitudes and and determine what was the nearest city to it. It also took the 
weather information from each place and gave us minumum and maximum temperatures time and other data about the place
During the project i encounted a lot of problems some of wwhich i was not able to solve mainly with the api keys
as it is best practice to keep them hidden. when ever i tried to import them the program was not able to find them there was a lot 
of back and forth trying to figure out what was stopping it from happening. i will say i need a lot more practice with it as i do not comepletly understand
it and how to use them correctly.
